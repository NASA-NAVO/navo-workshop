This would give us color. Or we need B- OR V- band magnitude and the stellar temperature.\n",

So first we start by searching for an existing catalog with data on Pleiades that will provide the necessary information about the stars: magnitudes in two bands (e.g., B and V), which can be used to measure color, or temperature of the star plus one magnitude."
