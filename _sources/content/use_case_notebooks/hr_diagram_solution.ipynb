This would give us color. Or we need B- OR V- band magnitude and the stellar temperature.\n",

    "To simplify this problem, we want to find a catalog of an open cluster of stars, where all the stars were born around the same time and are located in one cluster. This simplifies the issue of getting accurate distances to the stars. One famous cluster is the Pleiades in the constellation of Taurus. So first we start by searching for an existing catalog with data on Pleiades that will provide the necessary information about the stars: magnitudes in two bands (e.g., B and V), which can be used to measure color, or temperature of the star plus one magnitude."

This has expanded the existent list to 369 field stars for which a k-index is available, including many more Am stars. All available k-index data for field stars are presented here. Introduction: The present work represents a continuation of that described previously (Henry 1968ApJ...152L..87H, 1969ApJS...18...47H = II/42, [hereinafter referenced as Paper I]), in which the K-line of calcium at 3933{AA} is measured photoelectrically in A-type stars with a narrow-band spectrometer. The result for each star is a K-line strength index, called k, the value of which appears to depend predominantly only on the temperature of the star and the abundance of calcium in its atmosphere. The temperature dependence is well known; the abundance dependence appears as a correlation between the residual dK in K (after allowance for the temperature effect) and the difference from normal of the general metallicity index [m1] of Stromgren. Alternatively, it was shown in Paper I that the calcium abundance is probably the effective factor in producing the scatter in the relation between k and b-y by a process of elimination of other parameters (luminosity, etc.) that were found not to affect appreciably the value of k. The value of k is, however, affected by a third parameter, namely, whether the star is an Am star or not. Many of the stars of Paper I were reobserved in order to tie in the new measurements with the old ones. An emphasis was laid on observing more Am stars, and on observing some stars that are of somewhat earlier spectral types than the earliest ones observed previously. Simultaneously with the field-star measurements described here, extensive data were acquired for the A stars in five open clusters (Hyades, Pleiades, IC 2391, IC 2602, and NGC 6475) and one association (Orion), as described in Paper III (Hesser &amp; Henry 1971ApJS...23..453H). The observations were made with the same instrument that was used to obtain the data for Paper I, and a description of the instrument may be found in that paper.</td><td>tap#aux</td></tr>\n",

By combining the data from six observations, a high sensitivity, greater than a factor of 5 with respect to recent Chandra observations, has been achieved. Kaplan-Meier estimators of the cumulative X-ray luminosity distribution, statistically corrected for non-member contaminants, were built by the authors and compared to those of the nearly coeval Pleiades cluster. 431 X-ray sources were detected, and 234 of them have as optical counterparts cluster stars spanning the entire NGC 2516 main sequence. On the basis of X-ray emission and optical photometry, 20 new candidate members of the cluster have been identified; at the same time there are 49 X-ray sources without known optical or infrared counterpart. The X-ray luminosities of cluster stars span the range log L&amp;lt;sub&amp;gt;x&amp;lt;/sub&amp;gt; (erg s&amp;lt;sup&amp;gt;-1&amp;lt;/sup&amp;gt;) = 28.4 - 30.8. The representative coronal temperatures span the 0.3 - 0.6 keV (3.5 - 8 MK) range for the cool component and 1.0 - 2.0 keV (12 - 23 MK) for the hot one; similar values were found in other young open clusters like the Pleiades, IC 2391, and Blanco 1. While no significant differences were found in their X-ray spectra, NGC 2516 solar-type stars are definitely less luminous in X-rays than their nearly coeval Pleiades counterparts. The comparison with a previous ROSAT survey reveals the lack of variability amplitudes larger than a factor of 2 in solar-type cluster stars in a ~ 11 yr time scale, and thus activity cycles like in the Sun are probably absent or have a different period and amplitude in young stars. NGC 2516 has been observed several times with XMM-Newton during the first two years of satellite operations for calibration purposes. The observations used in this analysis span a period of 19 months with exposure times between 10 and 20 ks. All of these observations have been performed with the thick filter. In the combined EPIC datasets the authors detected 431 X-ray sources with a significance level greater than 5.0 sigma, which should lead statistically to at most one spurious source in the field of view.

For the sources with 2MASS counterparts, the values of their magnitudes in the J, H and K bands are also given. Very little is known about the evolution of stellar activity between the ages of the Hyades (0.8 Gyr) and the Sun (4.6 Gyr). To gain information on the typical level of coronal activity at a star&amp;#39;s intermediate age, the authors have studied the X-ray emission from stars in the 1.9 Gyr-old open cluster NGC 752. They analyzed a ~ 140 ks Chandra observation of NGC 752 and a ~50 ks XMM-Newton observation of the same cluster. They detected 262 X-ray sources in the Chandra data and 145 sources in the XMM-Newton observation. Around 90% of the catalogued cluster members within Chandra&amp;#39;s field of view are detected in the X-ray observation. The X-ray luminosity of all observed cluster members (28 stars) and of 11 cluster member candidates was derived. These data indicate that, at an age of 1.9 Gyr, the typical X-ray luminosity L&amp;lt;sub&amp;gt;x&amp;lt;/sub&amp;gt; of the cluster members with masses of 0.8 to 1.2 solar masses is 1.3 x 10&amp;lt;sup&amp;gt;28&amp;lt;/sup&amp;gt; erg s&amp;lt;sup&amp;gt;-1&amp;lt;/sup&amp;gt;, which is approximately a factor of 6 times less intense than that observed in the younger Hyades. Given that L&amp;lt;sub&amp;gt;x&amp;lt;/sub&amp;gt; is proportional to the square of a star&amp;#39;s rotational rate, the median L&amp;lt;sub&amp;gt;x&amp;lt;/sub&amp;gt; of NGC 752 is consistent, for t &amp;gt;= 1 Gyr, with a decaying rate in rotational velocities v&amp;lt;sub&amp;gt;rot&amp;lt;/sub&amp;gt; ~ t&amp;lt;sup&amp;gt;-alpha&amp;lt;/sup&amp;gt; with alpha ~ 0.75, steeper than the Skumanich relation (alpha ~ 0.5) and significantly steeper than that observed between the Pleiades and the Hyades (where alpha &amp;lt;0.3), suggesting that a change in the rotational regimes of the stellar interiors is taking place at an age of ~ 1 Gyr. The 135 ks observation of NGC 752 was performed by the Chandra ACIS camera on September 29, 2003 starting at 21:11:59 UT. The X-ray source detection was performed on the event list using the Wavelet Transform detection algorithm developed at Palermo Astronomical Observatory PWDETECT, available at &amp;lt;a href=&quot;http://oapa.astropa.unipa.it/progetti_ricerca/PWDetect&quot;&amp;gt;http://oapa.astropa.unipa.it/progetti_ricerca/PWDetect&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;. Initially, the energy range 0.2 - 10 keV was selected and the threshold for source detection was taken as to ensure a maximum of 1-2 spurious sources per field. 169 sources were detected in this way. The analysis of these sources hardness ratios showed, however, that all the catalogued stars in the field had low hardness ratios, HR &amp;lt; ~ 0.2, where HR is the number of photons in the 2 - 8 keV band over the number in the 0.5 - 2 keV band. Thus, to maximize the detection of stellar sources, PWDETECT was applied to the event list in the energy range from 0.5 - 2 keV. Using a detection threshold which ensures less than 1 spurious source per field leads to the detection of 188 sources, while lowering this threshold to 10 spurious sources per field, allows 262 sources to be identified in this energy range. This is a significant increase (well above the number expected if all the additional sources were spurious), thus the authors retained this list of 262 sources as their final list of sources in the NGC 752 field, with the caveat that ~ 10 sources among them are likely spurious. Note that the existence of ~ 10 spurious sources in the list is not so much of a problem in this context, because cluster members or candidate members are identified by the existence of a visible or near-IR counterpart. The authors searched for 2MASS counterparts to the X-ray sources using the 2MASS Point Source Catalogue (PSC) and a search radius of 3 arcsec and found a counterpart for 43 sources. Searching within the Point Source Reject Table of the 2MASS Extended Mission leads to the further identification of 1 counterpart (source number 87). This table was created by the HEASARC in October 2008 based on the electronic version of Table 6 from the reference paper which was obtained from the CDS website, i.e., their catalog J/A+A/490/113 file table6.dat.

       "<tr><td>143</td><td>NGC752XMM</td><td>NGC 752 XMM-Newton X-Ray Point Source Catalog</td><td>This table provides a list of X-ray sources detected in a ~50 ks XMM-Newton X-ray observation of the open cluster NGC 752. For the sources with 2MASS counterparts, the values of their magnitudes in the J, H and K bands are also given. Additionally, for the sources with a Chandra counterpart (within a search radius of 5 arcsec), the values of their Chandra source number (as given in the related Browse table NGC752CXO) are also given. Very little is known about the evolution of stellar activity between the ages of the Hyades (0.8 Gyr) and the Sun (4.6 Gyr). To gain information on the typical level of coronal activity at a star&amp;#39;s intermediate age, the authors have studied the X-ray emission from stars in the 1.9 Gyr-old open cluster NGC 752. They analyzed a ~ 140 ks Chandra observation of NGC 752 and a ~50 ks XMM-Newton observation of the same cluster. They detected 262 X-ray sources in the Chandra data and 145 sources in the XMM-Newton observation. Around 90% of the catalogued cluster members within Chandra&amp;#39;s field of view are detected in the X-ray observation. The X-ray luminosity of all observed cluster members (28 stars) and of 11 cluster member candidates was derived. These data indicate that, at an age of 1.9 Gyr, the typical X-ray luminosity L&amp;lt;sub&amp;gt;x&amp;lt;/sub&amp;gt; of the cluster members with masses of 0.8 to 1.2 solar masses is 1.3 x 10&amp;lt;sup&amp;gt;28&amp;lt;/sup&amp;gt; erg s&amp;lt;sup&amp;gt;-1&amp;lt;/sup&amp;gt;, which is approximately a factor of 6 times less intense than that observed in the younger Hyades. Given that L&amp;lt;sub&amp;gt;x&amp;lt;/sub&amp;gt; is proportional to the square of a star&amp;#39;s rotational rate, the median L&amp;lt;sub&amp;gt;x&amp;lt;/sub&amp;gt; of NGC 752 is consistent, for t &amp;gt;= 1 Gyr, with a decaying rate in rotational velocities v&amp;lt;sub&amp;gt;rot&amp;lt;/sub&amp;gt; ~ t&amp;lt;sup&amp;gt;-alpha&amp;lt;/sup&amp;gt; with alpha ~ 0.75, steeper than the Skumanich relation (alpha ~ 0.5) and significantly steeper than that observed between the Pleiades and the Hyades (where alpha &amp;lt;0.3), suggesting that a change in the rotational regimes of the stellar interiors is taking place at an age of ~ 1 Gyr. NGC 752 was observed for 49 ks by the XMM-Newton EPIC camera on February 5, 2003 starting at 23:29:25 UT, and the nominal pointing was towards J2000.0 RA and Declination of (01:57:38, +37:47:60), thus the XMM-Newton field-of-view (FOV) includes the Chandra FOV. For the source detection, the authors used the PWXDETECT code developed at Palermo Observatory and derived from the analogous Chandra PWDETECT code based on wavelet transform analysis. This allows the three EPIC exposures (PN, MOS1 and MOS2) to be combined in order to gain a deeper sensitivity with respect to the source detection based on single images. There were 145 point sources detected in the energy band 0.5 - 2.0 keV. An extended source (not listed in this present table), very likely a galaxy cluster, is also visible in the EPIC data. The authors searched for 2MASS counterparts to the XMM-Newton sources using a search radius of 5 arcsec and found a counterpart for 38 sources. As for the Chandra data, all sources with a visible counterpart from DLM94 have also a 2MASS counterpart, so this leaves 15 XMM-Newton sources with a 2MASS counterpart and no counterpart in Daniel et al. (1994, PASP, 106, 281); of these, 3 were also detected by Chandra; of the other 12, 10 are outside the Chandra FOV, while two are within it (XMM-Newton sources 58 and 65). Source 65 was caught by XMM-Newton during the decay phase of a flare, which explains why it is not detected in the Chandra data. For source 58 there is no immediate explanation for this, since the light curve does not show evidence of a flare. No additional near-IR counterpart to the XMM-Newton sources was found within the Point Source Reject Table of the 2MASS Extended Mission.

      "The photoelectric measurements of the strength of the Calcium K-line has been extended by 223 stars of predominantly southern or equatorial declinations which are well distributed in right ascension. This has expanded the existent list to 369 field stars for which a k-index is available, including many more Am stars. All available k-index data for field stars are presented here. Introduction: The present work represents a continuation of that described previously (Henry 1968ApJ...152L..87H, 1969ApJS...18...47H = II/42, [hereinafter referenced as Paper I]), in which the K-line of calcium at 3933{AA} is measured photoelectrically in A-type stars with a narrow-band spectrometer. The result for each star is a K-line strength index, called k, the value of which appears to depend predominantly only on the temperature of the star and the abundance of calcium in its atmosphere. The temperature dependence is well known; the abundance dependence appears as a correlation between the residual dK in K (after allowance for the temperature effect) and the difference from normal of the general metallicity index [m1] of Stromgren. Alternatively, it was shown in Paper I that the calcium abundance is probably the effective factor in producing the scatter in the relation between k and b-y by a process of elimination of other parameters (luminosity, etc.) that were found not to affect appreciably the value of k. The value of k is, however, affected by a third parameter, namely, whether the star is an Am star or not. Many of the stars of Paper I were reobserved in order to tie in the new measurements with the old ones. An emphasis was laid on observing more Am stars, and on observing some stars that are of somewhat earlier spectral types than the earliest ones observed previously. Simultaneously with the field-star measurements described here, extensive data were acquired for the A stars in five open clusters (Hyades, Pleiades, IC 2391, IC 2602, and NGC 6475) and one association (Orion), as described in Paper III (Hesser & Henry 1971ApJS...23..453H). The observations were made with the same instrument that was used to obtain the data for Paper I, and a description of the instrument may be found in that paper.\n",

The total number of member stars in the outer part of the Pleiades in the spectral range F5-K0 (0.45<B-V<0.90) is now 81 which is comparable to the number of stars known in Hertzsprung's central area (88 stars) in the same spectral domain.

Five new long period spectroscopic binaries have been identified from the CORAVEL observations. We have found a clear mass segregation between binaries and single stars, which is explained by the greater average mass of the multiple systems. The mass function of the single stars and primaries appears to be significantly different. While the central part of the cluster is spherical, the outer part is clearly elliptical, with an ellipticity of 0.17. The various parameters describing the Pleiades are (for a distance of 125pc): core radius r_c_=0.6 deg (1.4pc), tidal radius r_t_=7.4 (16pc), half mass radius r_m/2_=0.88 (1.9pc), harmonic radius r=1.82 (4pc). Low-mass stars (later than K0) probably extend further out and new proper motion and radial velocity surveys over a larger area and to fainter magnitudes would be very important to improve the description of the cluster structure and complete mass function.\n",

      "The luminosity function (LF) of the Pleiades cluster stars was constructed for the study of the LF fine structure related to pre-main sequence (MS) stellar evolution. Theoretical luminosity functions based on present-day pre-MS and MS stellar models were constructed and compared with observations. We tested both power- and log-normal laws describing the cluster star Initial Mass Function (IMF). Both single star formation burst- and age spread-models were examined. The agreement between the observed Pleiades colour-magnitude diagram with the new HIPPARCOS distance and the theoretical ZAMS for a normal metallicity is excellent when the model positions in the HR diagram are corrected to the helium abundance Y=0.34. The corresponding age of the cluster is logt=7.95. Three features (dips) were found in the observed cluster LF in a magnitude range M_V_=5-12mag. Two of them (at M_V_=7.5mag and 9.5mag) are assumed to be field LF features: Wielen and Kroupa dips. Theoretical models fail to reproduce them. We attributed the third (brightest) detail (the dip at M_V_=5.5mag) to the pre-MS evolution of Pleiades stars. The observed Pleiades LF corresponds in its brighter part to the standard Population I IMF. The log-normal IMF fits the observations much better than a simple power-law IMF. The brightest LF feature could be reproduced in the theoretical LF if a substantial age spread of order of several tens of Myrs is supposed to exist among the Pleiades stars.\n",

      "On the basis of the best available member list and duplicity information, we have studied the radial structure of Praesepe and of the very young open cluster NGC 6231. We have found mass segregation among the cluster members and between binaries and single stars, which is explained by the greater average mass of the multiple systems. However, the degree of mass segregation for stars between 1.5 and 2.3M_{sun}_ is less pronounced in Praesepe than in the Pleiades. Furthermore, mass segregation is already present in the very young open cluster NGC 6231 although this cluster is likely still not dynamically relaxed. We discuss the implications of these results and propose a qualitative scenario for the evolution of mass segregation in open clusters. In Praesepe the mass function of single stars and primaries appears to be significantly different, like in the Pleiades. We observe an absence of ellipticity of the outer part of Praesepe.\n",

These new observations substantially improve upon both the sensitivity and the spatial resolution for this region of the Pleiades, allowing us to detect 18 cluster members not detected before and 16 members not included in the catalogs used in previous surveys. The high sensitivity of the present observations permits us to obtain more stringent upper limits for 72 additional members and also provides sufficient numbers of stars to enable us to explore the dependence of L_x_ on stellar rotation for the slow rotators of the Pleiades.

      "A long-term photometric monitoring of a selected sample of solar analogues has been carried out since early nineties as part of \"The Sun in tim\" project, which is aimed at a multiwavelength study of stars with solar-like global properties, but with different ages and thus at different stages of their evolution. The extended time sequence of ground-based observations collected over more than a decade as part of this program has revealed the existence of starspot cycles. Also from these data it is possible to investigate surface differential rotation of the stars. In this paper we present the photometry collected to date and report on cycles search for a selected subsample of five young single G0-G5V stars with ages between ~130Myr and 700Myr: EK Dra, {pi}^1^ UMa, HN Peg, {kappa}^1^ Cet, BE Cet. Also we include in this study the Pleiades-age (~130Myr) K0V star DX Leo (HD 82443). All the cited stars show activity cycles whose period is, furthermore, the first determined from photometric data. They are compared to those activity cycles derived from CaII H&K emission fluxes and differences are discussed. All the cycle periods, except for EK Dra, fit well the empirical relations with global stellar parameters derived from larger stellar samples. The following results are also inferred from the present study: i) the fastest rotating stars tend to have longer cycles; ii) the range in the observed cycle lengths seems to converge with stellar age from a maximum dispersion around the Pleiades' age towards the solar cycle value at the Sun's age; iii) the overall short- and long-term photometric variability increases with inverse Rossby number with very high correlation degree, indicating that the level of magnetic activity at least in photosphere is still controlled by the stellar rotation even on the longest time scales; iiii) the increase with inverse Rossby number of the long-term overall photometric variability seems to level off at the highest rotation rate, which may be interpreted as due to a saturation in the level of photospheric magnetic activity around the activity maximum.\n",

All the stars have been observed with ROSAT, and most of them have photometrically-measured rotation periods available. Our results confirm that two emission regimes exist, one in which the rotation period is a good predictor of the total X-ray luminosity, and the other in which a constant saturated X-ray to bolometric luminosity ratio is attained; we present a quantitative estimate of the critical rotation periods below which stars of different masses (or spectral types) enter the saturated regime.\n",

The sample comprises 254 RASS sources with optical counterparts of spectral types F to M distributed over six study areas located at |b|>~20{deg}, and Dec>=-9{deg}.

Radial velocities were measured for most of the 141 G and K type stars of the sample. Combined with proper motions these data were used to study the age distribution and the kinematical properties of the sample. Based on the lithium abundances half of the G-K stars were found to be younger than the Hyades (660Myr). About 25% are comparable in age to the Pleiades (100Myr). A small subsample of 10 stars is younger than the Pleiades. They are therefore most likely pre-main sequence stars.

To use new photometric and spectroscopic data in combination with existing data in the literature in order to improve the determination of the parameters of the system, its distance and reddening. New photometric and spectroscopic data are presented for HD 23642. The spectroscopic data are ``spectrally disentangled'' using the KOREL code. The new and literature photometric and radial velocity data are simultaneously analysed using the FOTEL code to obtain the orbital solution and derive the fundamental parameters of the two stars. The distance and reddening are determined by fitting 7-colour Geneva, B,V and Stroemgren colours, and considering surface-brightness relations for the two components in (B-V) and Stroemgren c_1_-index. The preferred distance is 138.0+/-1.5pc for a reddening of E(B-V)=0.025+/-0.003. The reddening value is larger than the 0.012 adopted in the recent works on this stars by Munari et al. (2004A&A...418L..31M) and Southworth et al. (2005A&A...429..645S), and smaller than other values in the literature for the cluster reddening. The distance is in agreement with other recent works on the distance to the Pleiades. A comparison with evolutionary models suggests that the inclusion of convective core overshoot gives a much better fit to the empirical mass-radius relationship obtained from the binary analysis. Both this comparison and the \"spectral disentangling\" are consistent with HD 23642 having [Fe/H]=+0.06, a value determined by the most recent spectroscopical analyses of Pleiades stars.\n",

It has been observed often, but so far no definitive and comprehensive membership determination is readily available. An observing programme was carried out to study the stellar population of Blanco 1, and especially the membership and binary frequency of the F5-K0 dwarfs. We obtained radial-velocities with the CORAVEL spectrograph in the field of Blanco 1 for a sample of 148 F-G-K candidate stars in the magnitude range 10<V<14. New proper motions and UBVI CCD photometric data from two extensive surveys were obtained independently and are used to establish reliable cluster membership assignments in concert with radial-velocity data. The membership of 68 stars is confirmed on the basis of proper motion, radial velocity, and photometric criteria. Fourteen spectroscopic- and suspected binaries (2 SB2s, 9 SB1s, 3SB?) have been discovered among the confirmed members. Thirteen additional stars are located above the main sequence or close to the binary ridge, with radial velocities and proper motions supporting their membership. These are probable binaries with wide separations. Nine binaries (7 SB1 and 2 SB2) were detected among the field stars. The spectroscopic binary frequency among members is 20% (14/68); however, the overall binary rate reaches 40% (27/68) if one includes the photometric binaries. The cluster mean heliocentric radial velocity is +5.53+/-0.11km/s based on the most reliable 49 members.

The aim of the project is to determine the shape of the mass function in the low-mass and substellar regimes in the pre-main sequence (27Myr) cluster IC4665 located at 350pc from the Sun. We have cross-matched the near-infrared photometric data from the Eighth Data Release (DR8) of the UKIRT Infrared Deep Sky Survey (UKIDSS) Galactic Clusters Survey (GCS) with previous optical data obtained with the Canada-France-Hawaii (CFH) wide-field camera to improve the determination of the luminosity and mass functions in the low-mass and substellar regimes. The availability of i and z photometry taken with the CFH12K camera on the Canada France Hawaii Telescope added strong constraints to the UKIDSS photometric selection in this cluster located in a dense region of our Galaxy. We have derived the luminosity and mass functions of the cluster down to J=18.5mag, corresponding to masses of ~0.025M_{sun}_ at the distance and age of IC4665 according to theoretical models. In addition, we have extracted new candidate members down to ~20 Jupiter masses in a previously unstudied region of the cluster. We have derived the mass function over the 0.6-0.04M_{sun}_ mass range and found that it is best represented by a log-normal function with a peak at 0.25-0.16M_{sun}_, consistent with the determination in the Pleiades.\n",

The analysis confirms that there is a strong link between activity, rotation and the lithium equivalent width excess, specially for the range Lum(bol)=0.5-0.2L_{sun}_ (about K2-K7 spectral types or 0.75-0.95M_{sun}_). It is not possible to disentangle these effects but we cannot exclude that the observed lithium overabundance is partially an observational effect due to enhanced activity, due to a large coverage by stellar spots induced by high rotation rates. Since a bona fide lithium enhancement is present in young, fast rotators, both activity and rotation should play a role in the lithium problem.\n",

      "The first Gaia Data Release contains the Tycho-Gaia Astrometric Solution (TGAS). This is a subset of about 2 million stars for which, besides the position and photometry, the proper motion and parallax are calculated using Hipparcos and Tycho-2 positions in 1991.25 as prior information. We investigate the scientific potential and limitations of the TGAS component by means of the astrometric data for open clusters. Mean cluster parallax and proper motion values are derived taking into account the error correlations within the astrometric solutions for individual stars, an estimate of the internal velocity dispersion in the cluster, and, where relevant, the effects of the depth of the cluster along the line of sight. Internal consistency of the TGAS data is assessed. . Values given for standard uncertainties are still inaccurate and may lead to unrealistic unit-weight standard deviations of least squares solutions for cluster parameters. Reconstructed mean cluster parallax and proper motion values are generally in very good agreement with earlier Hipparcos-based determination, although the Gaia mean parallax for the Pleiades is a significant exception. We have no current explanation for that discrepancy. Most clusters are observed to extend to nearly 15 pc from the cluster centre, and it will be up to future Gaia releases to establish whether those potential cluster-member stars are still dynamically bound to the clusters. The Gaia DR1 provides the means to examine open clusters far beyond their more easily visible cores, and can provide membership assessments based on proper motions and parallaxes. A combined HR diagram shows the same features as observed before using the Hipparcos data, with clearly increased luminosities for older A and F dwarfs.\n",

      "Star formation in the solar neighborhood is mainly traced by young stars in open clusters, associations, and in the field, which can be identified, for example, by their X-ray emission. The determination of stellar parameters for the optical counterparts of X-ray sources is crucial for a full characterization of these stars. This work extends the spectroscopic study of the RasTyc sample, obtained by the cross-correlation of the TYCHO and ROSAT All-Sky Survey catalogs, to stars fainter than V=9.5mag and aims to identify sparse populations of young stars in the solar neighborhood. We acquired 625 high-resolution spectra for 443 presumably young stars with four different instruments in the northern hemisphere. The radial and rotational velocity (vsini) of our targets were measured by means of the cross-correlation technique, which is also helpful to discover single-lined (SB1), double-lined spectroscopic binaries (SB2), and multiple systems. We used the code ROTFIT to perform an MK spectral classification and to determine the atmospheric parameters (Teff, logg, [Fe/H]) and and vsini of the single stars and SB1 systems. For these objects, we used the spectral subtraction of slowly rotating templates to measure the equivalent widths of the H{alpha} and LiI-6708A lines, which enabled us to derive their chromospheric activity level and lithium abundance. We made use of Gaia DR1 parallaxes and proper motions to locate the targets in the HR diagram and to compute the space velocity components of the youngest objects. We find a remarkable percentage (at least 35%) of binaries and multiple systems. On the basis of the lithium abundance, the sample of single stars and SB1 systems appears to be mostly (about 60%) composed of stars younger than the members of the UMa cluster. The remaining sources are in the age range between the UMa and Hyades clusters (about 20%) or older (20%). In total, we identify 42 very young (PMS-like) stars, which lie above or very close to the Pleiades upper envelope of the lithium abundance. A significant percentage (about 12%) of evolved stars (giants and subgiants) is also present in our sample. Some of these stars are also lithium rich (A(Li)>1.4).\n",

      "The evolution of lithium abundance over a star's lifetime is indicative of transport processes operating in the stellar interior. Aims. We revisit the relationship between lithium content and rotation rate previously reported for cool dwarfs in the Pleiades cluster. Methods. We derive new LiI 670.8nm equivalent width measurements from high-resolution spectra obtained for low-mass Pleiades members. We combine these new measurements with previously published ones, and use the Kepler/K2 rotational periods recently derived for Pleiades cool dwarfs to investigate the lithium-rotation connection in this 125Myr-old cluster. Results. The new data confirm the correlation between lithium equivalent width and stellar spin rate for a sample of 51 early K-type members of the cluster, where fast rotating stars are systematically lithium-rich compared to slowly rotating ones. The correlation is valid for all stars over the (J-Ks) color range 0.50-0.70mag, corresponding to a mass range from about 0.75 to 0.90M_{sun}_, and may extend down to lower masses. Conclusions. We argue that the dispersion in lithium equivalent widths observed for cool dwarfs in the Pleiades cluster reflects an intrinsic scatter in lithium abundances, and suggest that the physical origin of the lithium dispersion pattern is to be found in the pre-main sequence rotational history of solar-type stars.\n",

      "NGC 3532 is an extremely rich open cluster embedded in the Galactic disc, hitherto lacking a comprehensive, documented membership list. We provide membership probabilities from new radial velocity observations of solar-type and low-mass stars in NGC 3532, in part as a prelude to a subsequent study of stellar rotation in the cluster. Using extant optical and infra-red photometry we constructed a preliminary photometric membership catalogue, consisting of 2230 dwarf and turn-off stars. We selected 1060 of these for observation with the AAOmega spectrograph at the 3.9m Anglo-Australian Telescope and 391 stars for observations with the Hydra-South spectrograph at the 4m Victor Blanco Telescope, obtaining spectroscopic observations over a decade for 145 stars. We measured radial velocities for our targets through cross-correlation with model spectra and standard stars, and supplemented them with radial velocities for 433 additional stars from the literature. We also measured logg, Teff, and [Fe/H] from the AAOmega spectra. The radial velocity distribution emerging from the observations is centred at 5.43+/-0.04km/s and has a width (standard deviation) of 1.46km/s. Together with proper motions from Gaia DR2 we find 660 exclusive members, of which five are likely binary members. The members are distributed across the whole cluster sequence, from giant stars to M dwarfs, making NGC~3532 one of the richest Galactic open clusters known to date, on par with the Pleiades. From further spectroscopic analysis of 153 dwarf members we find the metallicity to be marginally sub-solar, with [Fe/H]=-0.07+/-0.10. We confirm the extremely low reddening of the cluster, E_B-V_=0.034+/-0.012mag, despite its location near the Galactic plane. Exploiting trigonometric parallax measurements from Gaia DR2 we find a distance of 484^+35^_-30_pc [(m-M)_0_=8.42+/-0.14mag]. Based on the membership we provide an empirical cluster sequence in multiple photometric passbands. A comparison of the photometry of the measured cluster members with several recent model isochrones enables us to confirm the 300Myr cluster age. However, all of the models evince departures from the cluster sequence in particular regions, especially in the lower mass range.\n",

      "Our scientific goal is to provide revised membership lists of the alpha Per, Pleiades, and Praesepe clusters exploiting the second data release of Gaia and produce five-dimensional maps ({alpha}, {delta}, {pi}, {mu}_{alpha}_cos{delta}, {mu}_{delta}_) of these clusters. We implemented the kinematic method combined with the statistical treatment of parallaxes and proper motions to identify astrometric member candidates of three of the most nearby and best studied open clusters in the sky. We cross-correlated the Gaia catalogue with large-scale public surveys to complement the astrometry of Gaia with multi-band photometry from the optical to the mid-infrared. We identified 517, 1248, and 721 bona fide astrometric member candidates inside the tidal radius of alpha Per, the Pleiades, and Praesepe, respectively. We cross-matched our final samples with catalogues from previous surveys to address the level of completeness. We update the main physical properties of the clusters, including mean distance and velocity, as well as core, half-mass, and tidal radii. We infer updated ages from the white dwarf members of the Pleiades and Praesepe. We derive the luminosity and mass functions of the three clusters and compare them to the field mass function. We compute the positions in space of all member candidates in the three regions to investigate their distribution in space. We provide updated distances and kinematics for the three clusters. We identify a list of members in the alpha Per, Pleiades, and Praesepe clusters from the most massive stars all the way down to the hydrogen-burning limit with a higher confidence and better astrometry than previous studies. We produce complete 5D maps of stellar and substellar bona fide members in these three regions. The photometric sequences derived in several colour-magnitude diagrams represent benchmark cluster sequences at ages from 90 to 600Myr. We note the presence of a stream around the Pleiades cluster extending up to 40 pc from the cluster centre.\n",

      "Within a sphere of 400pc radius around the Sun, we search for members of the Pisces-Eridanus (Psc-Eri) stellar stream in the Gaia Data Release 2 DR2) data set. We compare basic astrophysical characteristics of the stream with those of the Pleiades. We used a modified convergent-point method to identify stars with 2D - velocities consistent with the space velocity of the Psc-Eri stream and the Pleiades, respectively. We found 1387 members of the Psc-Eri stream in a G-magnitude range from 5.1mag to 19.3mag at distances between 80 and 380pc from the Sun. The stream has a nearly cylindrical shape with a length of at least 700pc and a thickness of 100pc. The accumulated stellar mass of the 1387 members amounts to about 770M_{sun}_, and the stream is gravitationally unbound. For the stream we found an age of about 135Myr. In many astrophysical properties Psc-Eri is comparable to the open cluster M45 (the Pleiades): in its age, its luminosity function (LF), its present-day mass function (PDMF) as well as in its total mass. Nonetheless, the two stellar ensembles are completely unlike in their physical appearance. We cautiously give two possible explanations for this disagreement: (i) the star-formation efficiency in their parental molecular clouds was higher for the Pleiades than for Psc-Eri or/and (ii) the Pleiades had a higher primordial mass segregation immediately after the expulsion of the molecular gas of the parental cloud.\n",

      "Debris discs orbiting young stars are key to understand dust evolution and the planetary formation process.We take advantage of a recent membership analysis of the 30Myr nearby open cluster IC 4665 based on the Gaia and DANCe surveys to revisit the disc population of this cluster. We aim to study the disc population of IC 4665 using Spitzer (MIPS and IRAC) and WISE photometry. We use several colour-colour diagrams with empirical photospheric sequences to detect the sources with an infrared excess. Independently, we also fit the spectral energy distribution (SED) of our debris disc candidates with the Virtual Observatory SED analyser (VOSA) which is capable of automatically detecting infrared excesses and provides effective temperature estimates. We find six candidates debris disc host-stars (five with MIPS and one with WISE) and two of them are new candidates. We estimate a disc fraction of 24+/-10% for the B-A stars, where our sample is expected to be complete. This is similar to what has been reported in other clusters of similar ages (Upper Centaurus Lupus, Lower Centaurus Crux, the $\\beta$ Pictoris moving group, and the Pleiades). For solar type stars we find a disk fraction of 9+/-9%, lower than that observed in regions with comparable ages. Our candidates debris disc host-stars are excellent targets to be studied with ALMA or the future James Webb Space Telescope (JWST).\n",

      "We wish to measure the cool star rotation period distribution for the Pleiades-age rich open cluster NGC 2516 and use it to determine whether cluster-to-cluster variations exist in otherwise identical open clusters. We obtained 42d-long time-series CCD photometry of NGC 2516 in the V and Ic filters using the Yale 1m telescope at CTIO and performed a number of related analyses, including PSF-based time-series photometry. Our data are complemented with additional information from several photometric datasets, literature radial velocities, and Gaia DR2 astrometry. All available data are used to construct an integrated membership list for NGC 2516, containing 844 stars in our ~1 degree field of view. We derived 308 rotation periods for late-F to mid-M cluster members from our photometry. We identified an additional 247 periodic M dwarf stars from a prior study as cluster members, and used these to construct a 555-star rotation period distribution for NGC 2516. The colour-period diagram (in multiple colours) has almost no outliers and exhibits the anticipated triangular shape, with a diagonal slow rotator sequence that is preferentially occupied by the warmer stars along with a flat fast rotator sequence that is preferentially populated by the cooler cluster members. We also find a group of extremely slowly rotating M dwarfs (10d<P<23d), forming a branch in the colour-period diagram which we call the 'extended slow rotator sequence'. This, and other features of the rotational distribution can also be found in the Pleiades, making the colour-period diagrams of the two clusters nearly indistinguishable. A comparison with the well-studied (and similarly aged) open cluster M 35 indicates that the cluster's rotational distribution is also similarly indistinguishable from that of NGC 2516. Those for the open clusters M 50 and Blanco 1 are similar, but data issues for those clusters make the comparisons somewhat more ambiguous. Nevertheless, we demonstrate the existence of a representative zero-age main sequence (ZAMS) rotational distribution and provide a simple colour-independent way to represent it. We perform a detailed comparison of the NGC 2516 rotation period data with a number of recent rotational evolution models. Using X-ray data from the literature, we also construct the first rotation-activity diagram for solar-type stars in NGC 2516, one that we find is essentially indistinguishable from those for the Pleiades and Blanco 1. The two clusters NGC 2516 and Pleiades can be considered twins in terms of stellar rotation and related properties (and M 35, M 50, and Blanco 1 are similar), suggesting that otherwise identical open clusters also have intrinsically similar cool star rotation and activity distributions.\n",

      "A very rich cluster intermediate in age between the Pleiades (150Myr) and the Hyades (600Myr) is needed to probe the rotational evolution, especially the transition between fast and slow rotation that occurs between the two ages. We study the rich 300Myr-old open cluster NGC 3532 to probe this important transition and to provide constraints on angular momentum loss. Measuring the rotation periods builds on our prior work of providing spectroscopic membership information for the cluster, and it supports the chromospheric activity measurements of cluster stars that we provide in a companion paper. Using 42d-long photometric time series observations obtained with the Yale 1m telescope at CTIO, we measured rotation periods for members of NGC 3532 and compared them with the predictions of angular momentum evolution models. We directly measured 176 photometric rotation periods for the cluster members. An additional 113 photometric rotation periods were identified using activity information, described fully in the companion paper, resulting in a total sample containing 279 rotation periods for FGKM stars in NGC 3532. The colour-period diagram constructed from this rich data set shows a well-populated and structured slow rotator sequence, and a fast rotator sequence evolved beyond zero-age main sequence age whose stars are in transition from fast to slow rotation. The slow rotator sequence itself is split into slightly slower and faster rotators, a feature we trace to photometric binary status. We also identify an extended slow rotator sequence extending to P~32d, apparently the analogue of the one we previously identified in NGC 2516. We compare our period distribution to rotational isochrones in colour-period space and find that all considered models have certain shortcomings. Using more detailed spin-down models, we evolve the rotation periods of the younger NGC 2516 forward in time and find that the spindown of the models is too aggressive with respect to the slow rotators. In contrast, stars on the evolved fast rotator sequence are not spun down strongly enough by these models. Our observations suggest a shorter crossing time for the rotational gap, one we estimate to be ~80Myr for early-K dwarfs.\n",

      "Gyrochronology is one of the methods currently used to estimate the age of stellar open clusters. Hundreds of new clusters, associations, and moving groups unveiled by Gaia and complemented by accurate rotation period measurements provided by recent space missions such as Kepler and TESS are allowing us to significantly improve the reliability of this method. Aims. We use gyrochronology, that is, the calibrated age-mass-rotation relation valid for low-mass stars, to measure the age of the recently discovered moving group Group X. We extracted the light curves of all candidate members from the TESS full frame images and measured their rotation periods using different period search methods. Results. We measured the rotation period of 168 of a total of 218 stars and compared their period-colour distribution with those of two age-benchmark clusters, the Pleiades (125Myr) and Praesepe (625Myr), as well as with the recently characterised open cluster NGC 3532 (300Myr). As result of our analysis, we derived a gyro age of 300+/-60Myr. We also applied as independent methods the fitting of the entire isochrone and of the three brightest candidate members individually with the most precise stellar parameters, deriving comparable values of 250 Myr and 290 Myr, respectively. Our dating of Group X allows us to definitively rule out the previously proposed connection with the nearby but much older Coma Berenices cluster.\n",

      "Open clusters serve as a useful tool for calibrating models of the relationship between mass, rotation, and age for stars with an outer convection zone due to the homogeneity of the stars within the cluster. Cluster to cluster comparisons are essential to determine whether the universality of spin-down relations holds. NGC 6709 is chosen as a more distant representative Pleiades-age cluster for which no rotation periods of members have previously been obtained. This cluster is at a distance of over 1 kpc and has two red giant members. Isochrones place the age of the cluster at around 150Myr, or approximately the same age as the Pleiades. Photometry is obtained over a multi-month observing season at the robotic observatory for STELLar Activity (STELLA). After basic processing, point- spread function photometry was derived using Daophot II, and a suite of related software allowed us to create time series of relative magnitude changes for each star. Four time series analysis methods are then applied to these light curves to obtain rotation periods for members stars. We obtain for the first time rotation periods for 45 FGK cluster members of NGC 6709. We plot the Gaia DR3 colors of the member stars against their rotation periods and find a slow-rotating sequence with increasing rotation periods towards redder stars and a smaller clump of rapid rotators that have not yet joined this sequence. NGC 6709 has rotation periods very similar to that of another Pleiades-age open cluster, NGC 2516.\n",

      "The Gaia astrophysical parameters inference system (Apsis) provides astrophysical parameter estimates for several to hundreds of millions of stars. Aims. We aim to benchmark Gaia DR3 Apsis. We compiled approximately 1500 bona fide single stars in the Hyades and Pleiades open clusters for validation of PARSEC isochrones, and for comparison with Apsis estimates. PARSEC stellar isochrones in the Gaia photometric system enable us to assign average ages and metallicities to the clusters, and mass, effective temperature, luminosity, and surface gravity to the individual stars. Apsis does not recover the single-age, single-metallicity characteristic of the cluster populations. Ages assigned to cluster members seemingly follow the input template for Galactic populations, with earlier-type stars being systematically assigned younger ages than later-type stars. Cluster metallicities are underestimated by 0.1 to 0.2dex. Effective temperature estimates are in general reliable. Surface gravity estimates reveal strong systematic errors for specific ranges of the Gaia BP-RP colours. We caution that Gaia DR3 Apsis estimates can be subject to significant systematic uncertainties. Some of the Apsis estimates, such as metallicity, might only be meaningful for statistical studies of the time-averaged Galactic stellar population, but are not recommended to be used for individual stars.\n",

      "Open clusters are groups of coeval stars sharing properties such as distance and metallicity, and they are key to understanding stellar evolution. Our main goal is to study the evolution of open clusters with a special focus on the universality of the luminosity function. We applied an upgraded version of the convergent point technique on about 50 open clusters. The selection of cluster members was based purely on the exquisite astrometry of the Gaia DR3 and Hipparcos catalogues in the five-dimensional or full six-dimensional space. We present updated lists of bona fide members of ~50 open clusters within 500pc and younger than 1Gyr, exploiting the full depth of the third Gaia data release complemented by Hipparcos at the bright end, excluding regions in the Galactic plane. Our catalogues also are complemented by optical and infrared photometry from the major large-scale public surveys. All the data will be made available on a dedicated webpage with interactive plots and a direct link to Aladin and Vizier hosted at the Centre de Donnees de Strasbourg. We derived luminosity functions for all bound clusters and compared them in three age groups of ~50Myr, ~150Myr, and ~600Myr, discussing similarities and differences to constrain their dynamical evolution. Luminosity functions of clusters at 50Myr are more likely similar to each other and show a greater degree of similarity than older clusters. We explain this observation with the universal luminosity function within the volume of our sample (500pc). Luminosity functions of clusters with ages similar to the Pleiades or Hyades are more diverse, perhaps due to internal dynamical evolution, but more work is needed to provide additional evidence.\n",

      "Lithium (Li) abundance is an age indicator for G, K, and M stellar types, as its abundance decreases over time for these spectral types. However, despite the observational efforts made over the past few decades, the role of rotation, activity, and metallicity in the depletion of Li is still unclear. We have investigated how Li depletion is affected by rotation and metallicity in G and K members of the roughly Pleiades-aged open cluster M35. To do so, we have collected a sample of 165 candidate members observed with the WIYN/Hydra spectrograph. In addition, we have taken advantage of three previous spectroscopic studies of Li in M35. As a result, we have collected a final sample of 396 stars which we have classified as members and non-members of the cluster. We have measured iron abundances, Li equivalent widths, and Li abundances for the 110 M35 members added to the existing sample by this study. Finally, rotation periods for cluster members have been obtained from the literature or derived from Zwicky Transient Facility light curves. As a result, we have confirmed that fast G and K rotators are Li-rich in comparison with slow rotators of similar effective temperature. Furthermore, while we derived subsolar metallicity for M35 from our spectra, the distribution of Li in this cluster is similar to those observed for the Pleiades and M34, which have solar metallicity and slightly different ages. In addition, we have shown that an empirical relationship proposed to remove the contribution of the FeI line at 670.75nm to the blended feature at 670.78 nm overestimates the contribution of this iron line for M35 members. We conclude that a 0.2-0.3dex difference in metallicity makes little difference in the Li distributions of open clusters with ages between 100 and 250Myr.\n",

This work extends the first Blanco 1 spectroscopic study of Panagi et al. (1994A&A...285..233D). From a sample of four well-studied clusters, including Blanco 1, we find that the fraction of H{alpha} emission-line stars amongst K dwarfs is a good indicator of relative age, with a smaller fraction indicative of older age. Blanco 1 shows a relatively small fraction of emitters, inconsistent with previous age estimates for the cluster. We estimate the cluster age to to be 90+/-25Myr, slightly older than the Pleiades. The method is shown to be more sensitive to age than lithium and a useful alternative to other age measurement techniques. The variation of H{alpha} with (B-V) is similar to that observed in the older solar neighbourhood dwarfs, suggesting that, at least for the absorption-line stars, the contribution of stellar rotation to the equivalent width is unclear. We combine both spectroscopy and photometry to revise cluster membership and give accurate positions for all these stars.\n",

      "A complete sample of blue horizontal branch (BHB) stars in the magnitude range 13.0<V<16.5 is isolated in two Galactic fields that have previously been searched for RR Lyrae variables: SA 57 in the Northern Polar Cap and the Lick Astrograph field RR 7 in the Anticenter (l=183{deg}, b=+37{deg}). These BHB stars are a subset of the AF stars found in the Case Low-Dispersion Northern Survey; lists of these AF stars were made available by the late Nick Sanduleak. The completeness of the sample was confirmed by reference to the photometric survey of SA 57 by Stobie & Ishida (1987AJ93..... 624S) that is complete to fainter than V=18. In the color range 0.00<(B-V)_0_<+0.20, we can distinguish the BHB stars among these AF stars by comparing them both with well known local field horizontal branch (FHB) stars and also the BHB members of the halo globular clusters M3 and M92. The criteria for this comparison include (1) a (u-B)_K_ color index (derived from photoelectric observations using the Stromgren u filter and the Johnson B and V filters) that measures the size of the Balmer jump, (2) a spectrophotometric index A that measures the steepness of the Balmer jump, and (3) a parameter D_0.2_ that is the mean width of the H{gamma} and H{delta} Balmer lines measured at 20 percent of the continuum level. These criteria give consistent results in separating BHB stars from higher gravity main sequence AF stars in the color range 0.00<(B-V)_0_<+0.20. All three photometric and spectrophotometric criteria were measured for 35 stars in the SA 57 field and 37 stars in the RR 7 field that are in the color range (B-V)_0_<+0.23 and in the magnitude range 13.0<V<16.5. For a small number of additional stars only (u-B)_K_ was obtained. Among the AF stars that are fainter than B=13 and bluer than (B-V)_0_=+0.23, about half of those in the SA 57 field and about one third of those in the lower latitude RR 7 field are BHB stars. Isoabundance contours were located empirically in plots of the pseudoequivalent width versus (B-V)_0_ for the lines of Mg II A4481{AA}, Ca II A3933 {AA} and Fe I A4272{AA}. Solar abundances were defined by the data from main sequence stars in the Pleiades and Coma open clusters. Data from the BHB stars in M3 and M92 defined the [Fe/H]=1.5 and -2.2 isoabundance contours, respectively. Metallicities of all stars were estimated by interpolating the measured pseudoequivalent widths in these diagrams at the observed (B-V)_0_. The distribution of [Fe/H] found for the BHB stars in this way is very similar to that which we found for the RR Lyrae stars in the same fields using the Preston AS method. The space densities of these BHB stars were analyzed both separately and together with earlier observations of field BHB stars given by Arnold & Gilmore (1992MNRAS.257..225A), Sommer-Larsen & Christensen (1986MNRAS.219..537S), and Preston et al. (1991ApJ...375..121P). This analysis supports a two-component model for the halo of our Galaxy that is similar in many respects to that proposed by Hartwick [The Galaxy (Reidel, Dordrecht 1987)] although our discussion refers only to the region outside the solar circle. For Z>=35kpc, a classical spherical halo dominates which follows a R_gal_^-3.5^ space-density law and which has a HB morphology like that of the globular cluster M3 (i.e., approximately equal numbers of BHB and RR Lyrae stars). Closer to the galactic plane, there is an additional component with a much flatter galactic distribution (scale height ~2.2kpc near the Sun). The stars of the two components do not have significantly different metallicity distributions but do have slightly different distributions of the A parameter which measures the steepness of the Balmer jump; this is the only physical criterion (independent of spatial or kinematic considerations) which distinguishes between the two components. If present estimates of the local RR Lyrae star space density are correct, then the ratio of BHB stars to RR Lyrae stars is higher in the flatter halo component. The flat component would then have a bluer HB morphology (which could be interpreted as making it older) than the spherical component. In the solar neighborhood about 80 percent of the BHB stars come from the flat component and about 20 percent from the spherical component. More than half of the AF stars with V>13.0 and (B-V)_0_<+0.23 are not BHB stars but have surface gravities that are more like those expected for main sequence stars. Their measured metallicities lie in the range -0.2<[Fe/H]<-2.3. The more metal-poor of these stars are probably similar to the blue metal-poor stars that have been discussed by Preston et al. (1994AJ....108..538P) which, while they probably include globular cluster blue stragglers as a subset, must also comprise stars of other types.\n",

      "A ROSAT X-ray survey, with complementary optical photometry, of the open cluster NGC 6475 has enabled the detection of ~50 late-F to K0 and ~70 K/M dwarf new candidate members, providing the first reliable detection of low-mass stars in this low galactic latitude, 220Myr old cluster. The X-ray observations reported here have a typical limiting sensitivity of L_X_ ~ 10^29^erg/s. The detection frequency of early type cluster members is consistent with the hypothesis that the X-ray emitting early type stars are binary systems with an unseen, low-mass secondary producing the X-rays. The ratio between X-ray and bolometric luminosity among NGC 6475 members saturates at a spectral-type/color which is intermediate between that in much younger and in much older clusters, consistent with rotational spindown of solar-type stars upon their arrival on the ZAMS. The upper envelope of X-ray luminosity as a function of spectral type is comparable to that of the Pleiades, with the observed spread in X-ray luminosity among low-mass members being likely due to the presence of binaries and relatively rapid rotators. However, the list of X-ray selected candidate members is likely biased against low-mass, slowly rotating single stars. While some preliminary spectroscopic information is given in an appendix, further spectroscopic observations of the new candidate members will aid in interpreting the coronal activity among solar-type NGC 6475 members and their relation to similar stars in older and younger open clusters.\n",

      "Spectrophotometry is presented for 237 stars in 7 nearby open clusters: Hyades, Pleiades, Alpha Persei, Praesepe, Coma Berenices, IC 4665, and M39. The observations were taken by Lee McDonald and David Burstein using the Wampler single-channel scanner on the Crossley 0.9m telescope at Lick Observatory from 1973 July through 1974 December. Sixteen bandpasses spanning the spectral range 3500-7780{AA} were observed for each star, with bandwidths 32, 48, or 64{AA}. Data are standardized to the Hayes-Latham system to mutual accuracy of 0.016mag per passband. The accuracy of the spectrophotometry is assessed in three ways on a star-by-star basis. First, comparisons are made with previously published spectrophotometry for 19 stars observed in common. Second, (B-V) colors and uvby colors are compared for 236 stars and 221 stars, respectively. Finally, comparisons are made for 200 main sequence stars to the spectral synthesis models of Kurucz, fixing logg=4.0 and [Fe/H]=0.0, and only varying effective temperature. The accuracy of tests using uvby colors and the Kurucz models are shown to track each other closely, yielding an accuracy estimate (1{sigma}) of 0.01mag for the 13 colors formed from bandpasses longward of the Balmer jump, and 0.02mag for the 3 colors formed from the three bandpasses below the Balmer jump. In contrast, larger scatter is found relative to the previously published spectrophotometry of Bohm-Vitense & Johnson (1977ApJS...35..461B) (16 stars in common) and Gunn & Stryker (1983, Cat. <III/88>) (3 stars). We also show that the scatter in the fits of the spectrophotometric colors and the uvby filter colors is a reasonable way to identify the observations of which specific stars are accurate to 1{sigma}, 2{sigma}, .... As such, the residuals from both the filter color fits and the Kurucz model fits are tabulated for each star where it was possible to make a comparison, so users of these data can choose stars according to the accuracy of the data that is appropriate to their needs. The very good agreement between the models and these data verifies the accuracy of these data, and also verifies the usefulness of the Kurucz models to define spectrophotometry for stars in this temperature range (>5000K). These data define accurate spectrophotometry of bright, open cluster stars that can be used as a secondary flux calibration for CCD-based spectrophotometric surveys.

The rotation period distribution we determine, which is sensitive to periods 0.1<P<8days, shows a sharp cutoff for periods P<0.5days, corresponding to breakup velocity for these stars. Above 0.5days the distribution is consistent with a uniform distribution; we do not find evidence for a \"gap\" of periods at 4-5days. We find signatures of active accretion among stars at all periods; active accretion does not occur preferentially among slow rotators in our sample. We find no correlation between rotation period and near-IR signatures of circumstellar disks. In addition, we show that the distribution of vsini among stars in our sample bears striking resemblance to that of low-mass Pleiades stars. We discuss the implications of our findings for the evolution of stellar angular momentum during the pre-main-sequence phase. We argue that all stars in our sample must still deplete angular momentum by factors of roughly 5-10, if they are to preserve their vsini distribution over approximately the next 100Myr. We consider in detail whether our findings are consistent with disk-regulated stellar rotation.

With more than 500 new periods for Pleiades members, we are vastly expanding the number of Pleiades with periods, particularly at the low-mass end. About 92% of the members in our sample have at least one measured spot-modulated rotation period. For the ~8% of the members without periods, non-astrophysical effects often dominate (saturation, etc.), such that periodic signals might have been detectable, all other things being equal. We now have an unusually complete view of the rotation distribution in the Pleiades. The relationship between P and (V-K_s_)_0_ follows the overall trends found in other Pleiades studies. There is a slowly rotating sequence for 1.1<~(V-K_s_)_0_<~3.7 and a primarily rapidly rotating population for (V-K_s_)_0_>~5.0. There is a region in which there seems to be a disorganized relationship between P and (V-K_s_)_0_ for 3.7<~(V-K_s_)_0_<~5.0.

Those having complex and/or structured periodogram peaks, unresolved multiple periods, and resolved close multiple periods are likely due to spot/spot group evolution and/or latitudinal differential rotation; these largely compose the slowly rotating sequence in P versus (V-K_s_)_0_ identified in Paper I. The fast sequence in P versus (V-K_s_)_0_ is dominated by single-period stars; these are likely to be rotating as solid bodies.

The K2 light curves provide not only rotational periods but also detailed information from the shape of the phased light curve that was not available in previous studies. A slowly rotating sequence begins at (V-K_s_)_0_~1.1 (spectral type F5) and ends at (V-K_s_)_0_~3.7 (spectral type K8), with periods rising from ~2 to ~11 days in that interval. A total of 52% of the Pleiades members in that color interval have periods within 30% of a curve defining the slow sequence; the slowly rotating fraction decreases significantly redward of (V-K_s_)_0_=2.6. Nearly all of the slow-sequence stars show light curves that evolve significantly on timescales less than the K2 campaign duration. The majority of the FGK Pleiades members identified as photometric binaries are relatively rapidly rotating, perhaps because binarity inhibits star-disk angular momentum loss mechanisms during pre-main-sequence evolution. The fully convective late M dwarf Pleiades members (5.0<(V-K_s_)_0_<6.0) nearly always show stable light curves, with little spot evolution or evidence of differential rotation. During pre-main-sequence evolution from ~3Myr (NGC2264 age) to ~125Myr (Pleiades age), stars of 0.3M_{Sun}_ shed about half of their angular momentum, with the fractional change in period between 3 and 125Myr being nearly independent of mass for fully convective stars.

If true, this effect should be pronounced in young open clusters, due to the rapid rotation and strong magnetic activity of their most extreme members. We explore this possibility by determining empirical radii for 83 members of the nearby Pleiades open cluster, using spectral energy distribution fitting to establish F_bol_ with a typical accuracy of ~3% together with color and spectro-photometric indices to determine T_eff_. We find several Pleiades members with radii inflated above radius-T_eff_ models from state-of-the-art calculations, and apparent dispersions in radii for the K-dwarfs of the cluster. Moreover, we demonstrate that this putative radius inflation correlates strongly with rotation rate, consistent with inflation of young stars by magnetic activity and/or starspots. We argue that this signal is not a consequence of starspot-induced color anomalies, binarity, or depth effects in the cluster, employing Gaia DR1 distances as a check. Finally, we consider the lithium abundances of these stars, demonstrating a triple correlation between rotation rate, radius inflation, and enhanced lithium abundance. Our result-already significant to ~99.99% confidence-provides strong support for a magnetic origin of the inflated radii and lithium dispersion observed in young, low-mass stars.\n",

      "Parallaxes, proper motions, and optical photometry are presented for 51 systems consisting of 37 cool subdwarf and 14 additional high proper motion systems. Thirty-seven systems have parallaxes reported for the first time, 15 of which have proper motions of at least 1\"/yr. The sample includes 22 newly identified cool subdwarfs within 100 pc, of which three are within 25 pc, and an additional five subdwarfs from 100 to 160 pc. Two systems-LSR 1610-0040 AB and LHS 440 AB-are close binaries exhibiting clear astrometric perturbations that will ultimately provide important masses for cool subdwarfs. We use the accurate parallaxes and proper motions provided here, combined with additional data from our program and others, to determine that effectively all nearby stars with tangential velocities greater than 200 km/s are subdwarfs. We compare a sample of 167 confirmed cool subdwarfs to nearby main sequence dwarfs and Pleiades members on an observational Hertzsprung-Russell diagram using M_V_ versus (V-K_s_) to map trends of age and metallicity. We find that subdwarfs are clearly separated for spectral types K5-M5, indicating that the low metallicities of subdwarfs set them apart in the H-R diagram for (V-K_s_)=3-6. We then apply the tangential velocity cutoff and the subdwarf region of the H-R diagram to stars with parallaxes from Gaia Data Release 1 and the MEarth Project to identify a total of 29 new nearby subdwarf candidates that fall clearly below the main sequence.\n",

      "Detection of transiting exoplanets around young stars is more difficult than for older systems owing to increased stellar variability. Nine young open cluster planets have been found in the K2 data, but no single analysis pipeline identified all planets. We have developed a transit search pipeline for young stars that uses a transit-shaped notch and quadratic continuum in a 12 or 24 hr window to fit both the stellar variability and the presence of a transit. In addition, for the most rapid rotators (P_rot_<2 days) we model the variability using a linear combination of observed rotations of each star. To maximally exploit our new pipeline, we update the membership for four stellar populations observed by K2 (Upper Scorpius, Pleiades, Hyades, Praesepe) and conduct a uniform search of the members. We identify all known transiting exoplanets in the clusters, 17 eclipsing binaries, one transiting planet candidate orbiting a potential Pleiades member, and three orbiting unlikely members of the young clusters. Limited injection recovery testing on the known planet hosts indicates that for the older Praesepe systems we are sensitive to additional exoplanets as small as 1-2 R_{Earth}_, and for the larger Upper Scorpius planet host (K2-33) our pipeline is sensitive to ~4 R_{Earth}_ transiting planets. The lack of detected multiple systems in the young clusters is consistent with the expected frequency from the original Kepler sample, within our detection limits. With a robust pipeline that detects all known planets in the young clusters, occurrence rate testing at young ages is now possible.\n",

We establish ~1300 stars as probable members, ~80% of which are periodic. The phased LCs have a variety of shapes which can be attributed to physical causes ranging from stellar pulsation and stellar rotation to disk-related phenomena. We identify and discuss a number of observed behaviors. The periods are ~0.2-30 days with a peak near 2 days and the rapid period end nearing breakup velocity. M stars in the young USco region rotate systematically faster than GK stars, a pattern also present in K2 data for the older Pleiades and Praesepe systems. At higher masses (types FGK), the well-defined period-color relationship for slowly rotating stars seen in the Pleiades and Praesepe systems is not yet present in USco. Circumstellar disks are present predominantly among the more slowly rotating M stars in USco, with few disks in the subday rotators. However, M dwarfs with disks rotate faster on average than FGK systems with disks. For four of these disked M dwarfs, we provide direct evidence for disk locking based on the K2 LC morphologies. Our preliminary analysis shows a relatively mass-independent spin-up by a factor of ~3.5 between USco and the Pleiades, then mass-dependent spin-down between Pleiades and Praesepe.\n",

Only ~10% of our imaged pairs were previously known. We detect companions at red optical wavelengths, with physical separations ranging from a few tens to a few thousands of au. A three-sigma contrast curve generated for each final image provides upper limits to the brightness ratios for any undetected putative companions. The observations are sensitive to companions with a maximum contrast of ~6^m^ at larger separations. At smaller separations, the mean (best) raw contrast at 2\" is 3.8^m^ (6^m^), at 1\" is 3.0^m^ (4.5^m^), and at 0.5\" is 1.9^m^ (3^m^). Point-spread function subtraction can recover nearly the full contrast in the closer separations. For detected candidate binary pairs, we report separations, position angles, and relative magnitudes. Theoretical isochrones appropriate to the Pleiades and Praesepe clusters are then used to determine the corresponding binary mass ratios, which range from 0.2 to 0.9 in q=m_2_/m_1_. For our sample of roughly solar-mass (FGK type) stars in NGC 2264 and sub-solar-mass (K and early M-type) primaries in the Pleiades and Praesepe, the overall binary frequency is measured at ~15.5%+/-2%.

The Lithium abundance A(Li) follows a well-delineated decline from 3.15 for the hottest stars to upper limits =<1.0 among the coolest dwarfs. Contrary to earlier work, M35 includes single stars at systematically higher A(Li) than the mean cluster relation. This subset exhibits higher V_ROT_ than the more Li-depleted sample and, from photometric rotation periods, is dominated by stars classed as convective (C); all others are interface (I) stars. The cool, high-Li rapid rotators (RRs) are consistent with models that simultaneously consider rapid rotation and radius inflation; RRs hotter than the Sun exhibit excess Li depletion, as predicted by the models. The A(Li) distribution with color and rotation period, when compared to the Hyades/Praesepe and the Pleiades, is consistent with gyrochronological analysis placing M35's age between the older M34 and younger Pleiades. However, the Pleiades display a more excessive range in A(Li) and rotation period than M35 on the low-Li, slow-rotation side of the distribution, with supposedly younger stars at a given T_eff_ in the Pleiades spinning slower, with A(Li) reduced by more than a factor of four compared to M35.\n",

The stream was claimed to be ~1 Gyr old, which would make it an exceptional discovery for stellar astrophysics, as star clusters of that age are rare and tend to be distant, limiting their utility as benchmark samples. We test this old age for Psc-Eri in two ways. First, we compare the rotation periods for 101 low-mass members (measured using time-series photometry from the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite) to those of well-studied open clusters. Second, we identify 34 new high-mass candidate members, including the notable stars {lambda} Tauri (an Algol-type eclipsing binary) and HD 1160 (host to a directly imaged object near the hydrogen-burning limit). We conduct an isochronal analysis of the color-magnitude data for these highest-mass members, again comparing our results to those for open clusters. Both analyses show that the stream has an age consistent with that of the Pleiades, i.e., ~120 Myr. This makes the Psc-Eri stream an exciting source of young benchmarkable stars and, potentially, exoplanets located in a more diffuse environment that is distinct from that of the Pleiades and of other dense star clusters.\n",

Out of 156 of the highest-confidence Taurus members, we find that 81% are periodic. Our sample of young foreground stars is biased and incomplete, but nearly all stars (37/38) are periodic. The overall distribution of rotation rates as a function of color (a proxy for mass) is similar to that found in other clusters: the slowest rotators are among the early M spectral types, with faster rotation toward both earlier FGK and later M types. The relationship between period and color/mass exhibited by older clusters such as the Pleiades is already in place by Taurus age. The foreground population has very few stars but is consistent with the USco and Pleiades period distributions. As found in other young clusters, stars with disks rotate on average slower, and few with disks are found rotating faster than ~2days. The overall amplitude of the LCs decreases with age, and higher-mass stars have generally lower amplitudes than lower-mass stars. Stars with disks have on average larger amplitudes than stars without disks, though the physical mechanisms driving the variability and the resulting LC morphologies are also different between these two classes.\n",

      "On the pre-main sequence, the rotation rates of Sun-like stars are dictated by the interplay between the protostellar disk and the star's contraction. At ages exceeding 100Myr, magnetic spindown erases the initial stellar spin rate and enables rotation-based age dating (gyrochronology). The exact time at which the transition between these two regimes occurs depends on stellar mass, and has been challenging to empirically resolve due to a lack of viable calibration clusters. The {alpha}Persei open cluster (t~80Myr, d~170pc) may provide the needed calibrator, but recent analyses of the Gaia data have provided wildly varying views of its age and spatial extent. As such, we analyze a combination of TESS, Gaia, and LAMOST data to calibrate gyrochronology at the age of {alpha}Per and to uncover the cluster's true morphology. By assembling a list of rotationally confirmed {alpha}Per members, we provide strong evidence that {alpha}Per is part of a larger complex of similarly aged stars. Through kinematic back-integration, we show that the most diffuse components of {alpha}Per were five times closer together 50Myr ago. Finally, we use our stellar rotation periods to derive a relative gyrochronology age for {alpha}Per of 67%{+/-}12% the age of the Pleiades, which yields 86{+/-}16Myr given current knowledge. We show that by this age, stars more massive than ~0.8M{sun} have converged to form a well-defined slow sequence.\n",

An overall comparison of the survey results with those of previous surveys confirms the ubiquity of X-ray emission in the Pleiades cluster stars and its higher rate of emission with respect to older stars. It is found that the X-ray emission from dA and early dF stars cannot be proven to be dissimilar to that of Hyades and field stars of the same spectral type.

Using photometric indices, constructed from HST/NICMOS narrowband imaging, that measure the strength of the 1.9{mu}m water band, we determine the spectral type and reddening for every M-type star in the field, thereby separating cluster members from the interloper population. Due to the efficiency of our spectral classification technique, our study is complete from ~0.7 to 0.015M_{sun}_. The mass function derived for the cluster in this interval, dN/dlogM{prop.to}M^0.5^, is similar to that obtained for the Pleiades, but appears significantly more abundant in brown dwarfs than the mass function for companions to nearby Sunlike stars. This provides compelling observational evidence for different formation and evolutionary histories for substellar objects formed in isolation versus as companions. Because our determination of the IMF is complete to very low masses, we can place interesting constraints on the role of physical processes such as fragmentation in the star and planet formation process and the fraction of dark matter in the Galactic halo that resides in substellar objects.\n",

To fill this gap, we report P_rot_ for 132 low-mass Pleiades members (including nearly 100 with M=<0.45 M_{sun}_), measured from photometric monitoring of the cluster conducted by the Palomar Transient Factory in late 2011 and early 2012.

We find that rapid rotators have redder (V-K) colors than slower rotators at the same V, indicating that rapid and slow rotators have different binary frequencies and/or photospheric properties.

In this last regime, there is a bimodal distribution of periods, with few between ~2 and ~10 days. We interpret this to mean that once M stars start to slow down, they do so rapidly. The K2 period-color distribution in Praesepe (~790Myr) is much different than that in the Pleiades (~125Myr) for late F, G, K, and early-M stars; the overall distribution moves to longer periods and is better described by two line segments. For mid-M stars, the relationship has a similarly broad scatter and is steeper in Praesepe. The diversity of LCs and of periodogram types is similar in the two clusters; about a quarter of the periodic stars in both clusters have multiple significant periods. Multi- periodic stars dominate among the higher masses, starting at a bluer color in Praesepe ((V-Ks)~1.5) than in the Pleiades ((V-Ks)~2.6).

The large scatter in published velocities has led to claims that many are spectroscopic binaries, and in several cases, preliminary orbital solutions have been proposed. To investigate these claims, we obtained and report here velocity measurements for 33 rapidly rotating B, A, and early F stars in the Pleiades region, improving significantly on the precision of the historical velocities for most objects. With one or two exceptions, we do not confirm any of the previous claims of variability, and we also rule out all four of the previously published orbital solutions, for HD 22637, HD 23302, HD 23338, and HD 23410.

As part of this analysis, we introduce an iterative method based on spectral templates to perform an accurate correction of interstellar extinction of Gaia DR2 photometry, needed because of its wide photometric bandpasses. We show that the members of MUTA display an expected increased rate of stellar activity and faster rotation rates compared with older stars, and that literature measurements of the lithium equivalent width of nine G0- to K3-type members are consistent with our age determination. We show that the present- day mass function of MUTA is consistent with other known nearby young associations.

      "We analyze space-based time-series photometry of Sun-like stars, mostly in the Pleiades, but also field stars and the Sun itself. We focus on timescales between roughly 1hr and 1day. In the corresponding frequency band these stars display brightness fluctuations with a decreasing power-law continuous spectrum. K2 and Kepler observations show that the rms flicker due to this mid-frequency continuum (MFC) can reach almost 1%, approaching the modulation amplitude from active regions. The MFC amplitude varies by a factor up to 40 among Pleiades members with similar Teff, depending mainly on the stellar Rossby number Ro. For Ro<=0.04, the mean amplitude is roughly constant at about 0.4%; at larger Ro the amplitude decreases rapidly, shrinking by about two orders of magnitude for Ro~1. Among stars, the MFC amplitude correlates poorly with that of modulation from rotating active regions. Among field stars observed for 3yr by Kepler, the quarterly average modulation amplitudes from active regions are much more time variable than the quarterly MFC amplitudes. We argue that the process causing the MFC is largely magnetic in nature and that its power-law spectrum comes from magnetic processes distinct from the star's global dynamo, with shorter timescales. By analogy with solar phenomena, we hypothesize that the MFC arises from a (sometimes energetic) variant of the solar magnetic network, perhaps combined with rotation-related changes in the morphology of supergranules.\n",

      "We present the results of a spectroscopic monitoring program of the Pleiades region aimed at completing the census of spectroscopic binaries in the cluster, extending it to longer periods than previously reachable. We gathered 6104 spectra of 377 stars between 1981 and 2021, and merged our radial velocities with 1151 measurements from an independent survey by others started three years earlier. With the combined data spanning more than 43yr, we have determined orbits for some 30 new binary and multiple systems, more than doubling the number previously known in the Pleiades. The longest period is 36.5yr. A dozen additional objects display long-term trends in their velocities, implying even longer periods. We examine the collection of orbital elements for cluster members, and find that the shape of the incompleteness-corrected distribution of periods (up to 104 days) is similar to that of solar-type binaries in the field, while that of the eccentricities is different. The mass-ratio distribution is consistent with being flat. The binary frequency in the Pleiades for periods up to 104 days is 25%+/-3% after corrections for undetected binaries, which is nearly double that of the field up to the same period. The total binary frequency including known astrometric binaries is at least 57%. We estimate the internal radial velocity dispersion in the cluster to be 0.48+/-0.04km/s. We revisit the determination of the tidal circularization period, and confirm its value to be 7.2+/-1.0d, with an improved precision compared to an earlier estimate.\n",

Many of these candidates lie well in front of or behind the cluster from our point of view, so formerly they were considered cluster members, but their parallaxes put them more than 10pc from the center of the cluster today. Over the past 100Myr we estimate that the cluster has lost twenty percent of its mass including two massive white dwarf stars and the {alpha}^2^ Canum Venaticorum type variable star, 41 Tau. All three white dwarfs associated with the cluster are massive (1.01-1.06M _{sun}_) and have progenitors with main-sequence masses of about six solar masses.

The new near- and mid-IR photometry extend effectively 2 mag deeper than the 2MASS All-Sky Point Source catalog, and hence allow us to select a new set of candidate very low-mass and substellar mass members of the Pleiades in the central square degree of the cluster. We identify 42 new candidate members fainter than K_s_=14 (corresponding to 0.1M_{sun}_). These candidate members should eventually allow a better estimate of the cluster mass function to be made down to of order 0.04M_{sun}_.

      "The tension between the Hipparcos parallax of the Pleiades and other independent distance estimates continues even after the new reduction of the Hipparcos astrometric data and the development of a new geometric distance measurement for the cluster. A short Pleiades distance from the Hipparcos parallax predicts a number of stars in the solar neighborhood that are sub-luminous at a given photospheric abundance. We test this hypothesis using the spectroscopic abundances for a subset of stars in the Hipparcos catalog, which occupy the same region as the Pleiades in the color-magnitude diagram. We derive stellar parameters for 170 nearby G- and K-type field dwarfs in the Hipparcos catalog based on high-resolution spectra obtained using KPNO 4m echelle spectrograph. Our analysis shows that, when the Hipparcos parallaxes are adopted, most of our sample stars follow empirical color-magnitude relations. A small fraction of stars are too faint compared to main-sequence fitting relations by {Delta}M_V_>~0.3mag, but the differences are marginal at a 2{sigma} level, partly due to relatively large parallax errors. On the other hand, we find that the photometric distances of stars showing signatures of youth as determined from lithium absorption line strengths and R'_HK_ chromospheric activity indices are consistent with the Hipparcos parallaxes. Our result is contradictory to a suggestion that the Pleiades distance from main-sequence fitting is significantly altered by stellar activity and/or the young age of its stars, and provides an additional supporting evidence for the long-distance scale of the Pleiades.\n",

To achieve this we first demonstrate that the optimal extraction is insensitive to uncertainties in the measured position of the star. We then show how to correct the optimally extracted fluxes such that they correspond to those measured in a large aperture, so aperture photometry of standard stars can be used to place the measurements on a standard system. The technique simultaneously removes the effects of a position-dependent point spread function. Finally, we develop a method called 'ghosting', which calculates the completeness corrections in the absence of an accurate description of the point spread function. We apply these techniques to the young cluster NGC 2547 (=C0809-491), and use an X-ray-selected sample to find an age of 20-35Myr and an intrinsic distance modulus of 8.00-8.15mag.

Our derived luminosity function shows a well-defined Wielen dip, making NGC 2547 the youngest cluster in which such a feature has been observed.

Our analysis shows that for temperatures less than 4000K, the models systematically overestimate the flux by a factor of 2 at 0.5um, though this decreases with wavelength, becoming negligible at 2.2um. In optical colours this will result in the ages for stars younger than 10Myr being underestimated by factors of between 2 and 3. We show that using observations of standard stars to transform the data into a standard system can introduce significant errors in the positioning of pre-main sequences in colour-magnitude diagrams. Therefore, we have compared the models to the data in the natural photometric system in which the observations were taken. Thus we have constructed and tested a model of the system responses for the Wide-Field Camera on the Isaac Newton Telescope.

      "Rotation periods obtained with the Kepler satellite have been combined with precise measurements of projected rotation velocity from the WIYN 3.5-m telescope to determine the distribution of projected radii for several hundred low-mass (0.1<=M/M_{sun}_<=0.8), fast-rotating members of the Pleiades cluster. A maximum likelihood modelling technique, that takes account of observational uncertainties, selection effects and censored data, and considers the effects of differential rotation and unresolved binarity, has been used to find that the average radius of these stars is 14+/-2 per cent larger at a given luminosity than predicted by current evolutionary models of Dotter et al. and Baraffe et al. The same models are a reasonable match to the interferometric radii of older, magnetically inactive field M dwarfs, suggesting that the over-radius may be associated with the young, magnetically active nature of the Pleiades objects. No evidence is found for any change in this over-radius above and below the boundary marking the transition to full convection. Published evolutionary models that incorporate either the effects of magnetic inhibition of convection or the blocking of flux by dark star-spots do not individually explain the radius inflation, but a combination of the two effects might. The distribution of projected radii is consistent with the adopted hypothesis of a random spatial orientation of spin axes; strong alignments of the spin vectors into cones with an opening semi-angle <30{deg} can be ruled out. Any plausible but weaker alignment would increase the inferred over-radius.\n",

A maximum likelihood analysis that accounts for observational uncertainties, binarity, and censored data yields marginal evidence for radius inflation - the average radius of these stars is 6+/-4 per cent larger at a given luminosity than predicted by commonly used evolutionary models. This overradius is smaller (at 2{sigma} confidence) than was found for similar stars in the younger Pleiades using a similar analysis; any decline appears due to changes occurring in higher mass (>0.25M_{sun}_) stars. Models incorporating magnetic inhibition of convection predict an overradius, but do not reproduce this mass dependence unless superequipartition surface magnetic fields are present at lower masses. Models incorporating flux blocking by starspots can explain the mass dependence but there is no evidence that spot coverage diminishes between the Pleiades and Praesepe samples to accompany the decline in overradius. The fastest rotating stars in both Praesepe and the Pleiades are significantly smaller than the slowest rotators for which a projected radius can be measured. This may be a selection effect caused by more efficient angular momentum loss in larger stars leading to their progressive exclusion from the analysed samples. Our analyses assume random spin-axis orientations; any alignment in Praesepe, as suggested by Kovacs, is strongly disfavoured by the broad distribution of projected radii.\n",

      "We determine rotation periods for 127 stars in the ~115-Myr-old Blanco 1 open cluster using ~200d of photometric monitoring with the Next Generation Transit Survey. These stars span F5-M3 spectral types (1.2M_{sun}_>~M>~0.3M_{sun}_) and increase the number of known rotation periods in Blanco 1 by a factor of four. We determine rotation periods using three methods: Gaussian process (GP) regression, generalized autocorrelation function (G-ACF), and Lomb-Scargle (LS) periodogram, and find that the GP and G-ACF methods are more applicable to evolving spot modulation patterns. Between mid-F and mid-K spectral types, single stars follow a well-defined rotation sequence from ~2 to 10d, whereas stars in photometric multiple systems typically rotate faster. This may suggest that the presence of a moderate-to-high mass ratio companion inhibits angular momentum loss mechanisms during the early pre-main sequence, and this signature has not been erased at ~100Myr. The majority of mid-F to mid-K stars display evolving modulation patterns, whereas most M stars show stable modulation signals. This morphological change coincides with the shift from a well-defined rotation sequence (mid-F to mid-K stars) to a broad rotation period distribution (late-K and M stars). Finally, we compare our rotation results for Blanco 1 to the similarly aged Pleiades: the single-star populations in both clusters possess consistent rotation period distributions, which suggests that the angular momentum evolution of stars follows a well-defined pathway that is, at least for mid-F to mid-K stars, strongly imprinted by ~100Myr.\n",

If stars rotate as rigid bodies, the angular momentum of the vast majority is within clearly outlined bounds. The lower boundary defines a terminal main sequence rotational isochrone, the upper one coincides with slow rotators from the Pleiades and stars from Praesepe delineate a third one. Mass dependent exponential relationships between angular momentum and age are determined from these isochrones. Age estimates based on the angular momentum, are acceptable in middle aged stars older than 750Myr and more massive than 0.6-0.7M_{sun}_. The evolution of the Rossby number indicates that the Parker dynamo may cease early on in stars where M/M_{sun}_>=1.1. An empirical formula for the torque, an idealized model for it and a relation between rotational period and magnetic field, lead to a formula for the evolution of the mass loss rate, predicting that the present solar rate is close to a minimum and that it was around five times more vigorous when life on Earth started.\n",

Introduction: van den Bergh & Sher (1960) found from studying several open clusters that in general the faint end of the cluster luminosity function decreased or remained constant down to the level of observation. If true, the observed cluster luminosity functions are unable to account for the luminosity function of nearby field stars which increases to faint magnitudes. One possible solution is that additional unidentified low-mass stars exist in most (or all) open clusters. Recent studies in the Hyades (Weis & Hanson 1988AJ.....96..148W, Griffin et al. 1988AJ.....96..172G, Stauffer 1982AJ.....87..899S), Pleiades (Stauffer et al. 1991AJ....101..980S, Prosser et al. 1991AJ....101.1361P), and Praesepe (Mermilliod et al. 1990A&A...235..114M, Jones & Stauffer 1991AJ....102.1080J) have identified faint candidate members. It is the aim of this study to determine the existence, and some of the properties, of the low-mass membership in the open cluster Alpha Persei. Alpha Per was chosen for study because of the limited information on low-mass membership, because it is nearby (which enables both proper motion analysis and observation of low-mass candidates), because no other clusters of the same relatively youthful age have been studied completely, and because of the existence of the photographic plate material needed for the proper motion analysis. After a brief review of the history and previous work in this cluster, the proper motion survey of this study is described. This is accompanied by a description of the CCD photometry and spectroscopy programs employed to aid in identifying cluster members. A review of current information on previous members and possible members is also given, followed by a section presenting the new members and candidate members found in this study. An analysis of some cluster properties including luminosity function, age, spatial distribution of members, reddening, H-alpha emission strengths, and rotational velocity distribution is presented.

By combining the data from six observations, a high sensitivity, greater than a factor of 5 with respect to recent Chandra observations, has been achieved. Kaplan-Meier estimators of the cumulative X-ray luminosity distribution, statistically corrected for non-member contaminants, were built by the authors and compared to those of the nearly coeval Pleiades cluster. 431 X-ray sources were detected, and 234 of them have as optical counterparts cluster stars spanning the entire NGC 2516 main sequence. On the basis of X-ray emission and optical photometry, 20 new candidate members of the cluster have been identified; at the same time there are 49 X-ray sources without known optical or infrared counterpart. The X-ray luminosities of cluster stars span the range log L&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt; (erg s&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;) = 28.4 - 30.8. The representative coronal temperatures span the 0.3 - 0.6 keV (3.5 - 8 MK) range for the cool component and 1.0 - 2.0 keV (12 - 23 MK) for the hot one; similar values were found in other young open clusters like the Pleiades, IC 2391, and Blanco 1. While no significant differences were found in their X-ray spectra, NGC 2516 solar-type stars are definitely less luminous in X-rays than their nearly coeval Pleiades counterparts. The comparison with a previous ROSAT survey reveals the lack of variability amplitudes larger than a factor of 2 in solar-type cluster stars in a ~ 11 yr time scale, and thus activity cycles like in the Sun are probably absent or have a different period and amplitude in young stars. NGC 2516 has been observed several times with XMM-Newton during the first two years of satellite operations for calibration purposes. The observations used in this analysis span a period of 19 months with exposure times between 10 and 20 ks. All of these observations have been performed with the thick filter.

      "This table contains a list of point sources detected by XMM-Newton EPIC in a pointing towards the young open cluster NGC 2547, made in order to allow the authors to characterize coronal activity in solar-type stars, and stars of lower mass, at an age of 30 Myr. X-ray emission was seen from stars at all spectral types, peaking among G stars at luminosities (0.3 - 3 keV) of L&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt; ~= 10&lt;sup&gt;30.5&lt;/sup&gt; erg/s and declining to L&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt; &lt;= 10&lt;sup&gt;29&lt;/sup&gt; erg/s among M stars with masses &gt;=0.2 solar masses. Coronal spectra show evidence for multi-temperature differential emission measures and low coronal metal abundances of Z~= 0.3. Most of the solar-type stars in NGC 2547 exhibit saturated or even supersaturated X-ray activity levels. The median levels of L&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt; and L&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;/L&lt;sub&gt;bol&lt;/sub&gt; in the solar-type stars of NGC 2547 are very similar to those in T-Tauri stars of the Orion Nebula cluster (ONC), but an order of magnitude higher than in the older Pleiades. The spread in X-ray activity levels among solar-type stars in NGC 2547 is much smaller than in older or younger clusters. This table contains the properties of those X-ray sources which are correlated with optical cluster members (see Section 2.2 of the reference paper for details on the correlation procedure that was adopted), as well as the properties of those X-ray sources which are uncorrelated with any optical cluster members. The table lists the cross-identifications with optical catalogs for the candidate cluster sources along with their X-ray luminosities and X-ray to bolometric flux ratios, as well as the correlations between cluster members which were detected by XMM-Newton and those detected 7 years earlier by the ROSAT HRI instrument, along with the X-ray luminosities and flux ratios as determined by the HRI.

      "This table provides a list of X-ray sources detected in a ~140 ks Chandra X-ray observation of the open cluster NGC 752. For the sources with 2MASS counterparts, the values of their magnitudes in the J, H and K bands are also given. Very little is known about the evolution of stellar activity between the ages of the Hyades (0.8 Gyr) and the Sun (4.6 Gyr). To gain information on the typical level of coronal activity at a star&#39;s intermediate age, the authors have studied the X-ray emission from stars in the 1.9 Gyr-old open cluster NGC 752. They analyzed a ~ 140 ks Chandra observation of NGC 752 and a ~50 ks XMM-Newton observation of the same cluster. They detected 262 X-ray sources in the Chandra data and 145 sources in the XMM-Newton observation. Around 90% of the catalogued cluster members within Chandra&#39;s field of view are detected in the X-ray observation. The X-ray luminosity of all observed cluster members (28 stars) and of 11 cluster member candidates was derived. These data indicate that, at an age of 1.9 Gyr, the typical X-ray luminosity L&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt; of the cluster members with masses of 0.8 to 1.2 solar masses is 1.3 x 10&lt;sup&gt;28&lt;/sup&gt; erg s&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;, which is approximately a factor of 6 times less intense than that observed in the younger Hyades. Given that L&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt; is proportional to the square of a star&#39;s rotational rate, the median L&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt; of NGC 752 is consistent, for t &gt;= 1 Gyr, with a decaying rate in rotational velocities v&lt;sub&gt;rot&lt;/sub&gt; ~ t&lt;sup&gt;-alpha&lt;/sup&gt; with alpha ~ 0.75, steeper than the Skumanich relation (alpha ~ 0.5) and significantly steeper than that observed between the Pleiades and the Hyades (where alpha &lt;0.3), suggesting that a change in the rotational regimes of the stellar interiors is taking place at an age of ~ 1 Gyr. The 135 ks observation of NGC 752 was performed by the Chandra ACIS camera on September 29, 2003 starting at 21:11:59 UT. The X-ray source detection was performed on the event list using the Wavelet Transform detection algorithm developed at Palermo Astronomical Observatory PWDETECT, available at &lt;a href=\"http://oapa.astropa.unipa.it/progetti_ricerca/PWDetect\"&gt;http://oapa.astropa.unipa.it/progetti_ricerca/PWDetect&lt;/a&gt;. Initially, the energy range 0.2 - 10 keV was selected and the threshold for source detection was taken as to ensure a maximum of 1-2 spurious sources per field. 169 sources were detected in this way. The analysis of these sources hardness ratios showed, however, that all the catalogued stars in the field had low hardness ratios, HR &lt; ~ 0.2, where HR is the number of photons in the 2 - 8 keV band over the number in the 0.5 - 2 keV band. Thus, to maximize the detection of stellar sources, PWDETECT was applied to the event list in the energy range from 0.5 - 2 keV. Using a detection threshold which ensures less than 1 spurious source per field leads to the detection of 188 sources, while lowering this threshold to 10 spurious sources per field, allows 262 sources to be identified in this energy range. This is a significant increase (well above the number expected if all the additional sources were spurious), thus the authors retained this list of 262 sources as their final list of sources in the NGC 752 field, with the caveat that ~ 10 sources among them are likely spurious. Note that the existence of ~ 10 spurious sources in the list is not so much of a problem in this context, because cluster members or candidate members are identified by the existence of a visible or near-IR counterpart. The authors searched for 2MASS counterparts to the X-ray sources using the 2MASS Point Source Catalogue (PSC) and a search radius of 3 arcsec and found a counterpart for 43 sources. Searching within the Point Source Reject Table of the 2MASS Extended Mission leads to the further identification of 1 counterpart (source number 87). This table was created by the HEASARC in October 2008 based on the electronic version of Table 6 from the reference paper which was obtained from the CDS website, i.e., their catalog J/A+A/490/113 file table6.dat.

Additionally, for the sources with a Chandra counterpart (within a search radius of 5 arcsec), the values of their Chandra source number (as given in the related Browse table NGC752CXO) are also given.

NGC 752 was observed for 49 ks by the XMM-Newton EPIC camera on February 5, 2003 starting at 23:29:25 UT, and the nominal pointing was towards J2000.0 RA and Declination of (01:57:38, +37:47:60), thus the XMM-Newton field-of-view (FOV) includes the Chandra FOV. For the source detection, the authors used the PWXDETECT code developed at Palermo Observatory and derived from the analogous Chandra PWDETECT code based on wavelet transform analysis. This allows the three EPIC exposures (PN, MOS1 and MOS2) to be combined in order to gain a deeper sensitivity with respect to the source detection based on single images. There were 145 point sources detected in the energy band 0.5 - 2.0 keV. An extended source (not listed in this present table), very likely a galaxy cluster, is also visible in the EPIC data. The authors searched for 2MASS counterparts to the XMM-Newton sources using a search radius of 5 arcsec and found a counterpart for 38 sources. As for the Chandra data, all sources with a visible counterpart from DLM94 have also a 2MASS counterpart, so this leaves 15 XMM-Newton sources with a 2MASS counterpart and no counterpart in Daniel et al. (1994, PASP, 106, 281); of these, 3 were also detected by Chandra; of the other 12, 10 are outside the Chandra FOV, while two are within it (XMM-Newton sources 58 and 65). Source 65 was caught by XMM-Newton during the decay phase of a flare, which explains why it is not detected in the Chandra data. For source 58 there is no immediate explanation for this, since the light curve does not show evidence of a flare. No additional near-IR counterpart to the XMM-Newton sources was found within the Point Source Reject Table of the 2MASS Extended Mission.
