    "Suppose you want to do something using a column that you expect to find in a bunch of different tables, like coordinates and time.  It's a good bet that many if not most of the tables have coordinate columns, but there's no rule about what they have to be named.  \n",
    "\n",
    "When doing detailed catalog queries with the TAP, you can obviously examine the columns of every table you're interested in to find the columns you want.  Then you can hard-code the correct ones into each query for each table and service.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Or, you can also search for keywords like \"ra\" or \"ascension\" in the columns and their descriptions to get the columns you want automatically that way.  \n",
    "\n",
    "But is there are more generic way?  [Unified Content Descriptors (UCDs)](http://www.ivoa.net/documents/latest/UCD.html) are a VO standard that allows table publishers to name their columns whatever they (or their contributors) want but to identify those that contain standard sorts of data.  For example, the RA column could be called \"RA\", \"ra\", \"Right_Ascension\", etc.  But in all cases, a VO service can label the column with its UCD, which is \"pos.eq.ra\".  This information is not part of the table but part of the meta-data that the service may provide with that data. Though not required of all VO services, UCDs are commonly provided precisely to make such tasks as identifying the columns of interest easier to automate.  \n",
