# NASA-NAVO Notebooks

These notebooks demonstrate how to access NASA data through
python. Under the hood, they use Virtual Observatory protocols so that
the user does not need to know where the data are hosted but can
discover what is available and access it in standard ways.

They depend on the Astropy-affiliated Python package PyVO.

Please be sure your laptop is properly configured before the workshop by following the [installation and setup instructions]https://nasa-navo.github.io/navo-workshop/00_SETUP.html)

This could take as long as one hour depending on your current
configuration and internet speeds.

## Demo in Binder

This badge opens Jupyterlab session on Binder which can be used to run the workshop notebooks.

**Note** that method of running the notebooks is transient, and the session will disappear after
being left unattended for several minutes.
