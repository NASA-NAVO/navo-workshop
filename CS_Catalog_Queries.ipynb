    "# 4  Synchronous versus asynchronous queries\n",
    "\n",
    "There is one technical detail about TAP queries that you will need to know.  In the code cells above, there are two commands for sending the query, one of which is commented out.  This is because, with the TAP, there are two ways to send such queries.  The default when you use the `search()` method is to us a synchronous query, which means that the query is sent and the client waits for the response.  For large and complicated queries, this may time out, or you may want to run several in parallel.  So there are other options.  \n",
    "\n",
    "The method `service.run_async()` uses an asynchronous query, which means that the query is sent, and then (under the hood without you needing to do anything), the method checks for a response.  From your point of view, these methods look the same;  PyVO is doing different things under the hood, but the method will not return until it has your result. \n",
    "\n",
    "You need to know about these two methods for a couple of reasons.  First, some services will limit synchronous queries, i.e. they will not necessarily return *all* the results if there are too many of them.  An asynchronous query should have no such restrictions.  In the case of the HEASARC service that we use above, it does not matter, but you should be aware of this and be in the habit of using the asynchronous queries for complete results after an initial interactive exploration.  \n",
    "\n",
    "The second reason to be aware of this is that asynchronous queries may be queued by the service, and they can take a lot longer if the service is very busy or the job is very large.  (The synchronous option in this case may either time out, or it may return quickly but with incomplete results.)\n",
    "\n",
    "For very large queries, or for submitting queries in parallel, you may wish to use the `submit_job()`, `wait()`, and `fetch_results()` methods to avoid locking up your Python session.  This is described in the [pyvo documentation](https://pyvo.readthedocs.io/en/latest/dal/index.html#jobs).\n"
